<p>Every CBD cream that we make at cbdMD is crafted with only the highest-quality ingredients and no artificial perfumes or dyes.

<p>We also infused our Recover CBD cream with histamine dihydrochloride, an FDA-approved active ingredient that provides temporary pain relief and creates a gentle warming sensation by expanding blood vessels to the area where it’s applied. This makes Recover great for stiff joints and backs – for both athletes and desk jockeys alike!</p>
