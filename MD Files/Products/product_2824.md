## FAQ
"[\r\n{\r\n\"question\": \"Is cbdMD Max effective for long-term use?\",\r\n\"answer\": \"Yes, cbdMD Max Pain Relief Tablets are formulated specifically for long-term use. Taking one tablet a day can help maintain long-term wellness and pain relief without the inconsistent effects of short-term treatments.\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n\"question\": \"Can I use cbdMD Max daily?\",\r\n\"answer\": \"Absolutely! We encourage daily use of cbdMD Max. Generally, it takes a few days of consistent use to begin experiencing the effects, and ongoing usage aids in maintaining its effectiveness.\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n\"question\": \"Can I combine cbdMD Max with other CBD products?\",\r\n\"answer\": \"Yes, cbdMD Max can be used in conjunction with other CBD products. Each serving of cbdMD Max contains 200 mg of CBD, a suitable daily dose for most people.
